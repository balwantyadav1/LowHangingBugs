This Bash tool designed to check if domains have proper SPF (Sender Policy Framework) and DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance) records. The script can be used to identify vulnerable domains that lack these email authentication mechanisms.

Let Understand in more detail:

1. **Output File:**
   - The variable `output_file` is set to "SPFvulnerable.txt," which will store the list of vulnerable domains.

2. **Functions:**
   - `usage`: Displays examples of script usage and exits.
   - `style`: Defines colored output styles for use in printing the results.
   - `print`: Prints the vulnerability status of a domain based on SPF and DMARC records.
   - `log`: Logs additional details if the verbose option is enabled.
   - `version`: Displays the tool version and exits.
   - `spfdmarc_checker`: Checks SPF and DMARC records for a domain and prints the vulnerability status.
   - `target`: Processes a list of domains from a file, checking each one for SPF and DMARC records.
   - `single_domain`: Checks SPF and DMARC records for a single domain.

3. **Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The script accepts the following command-line options:
     - `-h` or `--help`: Displays usage information.
     - `--verbose`: Enables verbose output.
     - `-v` or `--version`: Displays the tool version.
     - `-t` or `--target`: Specifies a file containing a list of domains to check.

4. **Processing Command-Line Arguments:**
   - The script uses a `while` loop to process command-line arguments.
   - It sets variables and calls functions based on the provided options.

5. **Main Execution:**
   - If a target file (`-t` option) is provided, the script reads domains from the file and checks each one.
   - If a single domain is provided without the `-t` option, the script checks that domain.
   - For each domain, it uses `dig` to query SPF and DMARC records and determines their existence.
   - The results (vulnerable or not) are printed, and details are logged if the verbose option is enabled.
   - The list of vulnerable domains is appended to the output file.

6. **Exit:**
   - The script exits with a status of 0, indicating successful execution.
