This Python script is designed to check a list of URLs (read from the "allsub.txt" file) for the presence of specific security headers `Content-Security-Policy, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Strict-Transport-Security, Referrer-Policy `  in their HTTP responses. The script focuses on checking whether certain security headers are present in the HTTP responses and logs the URLs that are missing these headers.

Let Understand in more detail:

1. **File Path Setup:**
   - The variable `file_path` is set to "allsub.txt," representing the file from which the script reads a list of URLs.

2. **Read URLs from File:**
   - The script opens the specified file, reads its content line by line, and stores each line (URL) in the `lines` list.

3. **Iterate Over URLs:**
   - For each URL in the `lines` list, the script performs the following steps:

4. **HTTP Request:**
   - It sends an HTTP GET request to the current URL using the `requests.get` method.

5. **Check HTTP Response Status:**
   - If the HTTP response status code is not 200 (OK), it prints a message and skips to the next URL.

6. **Check for Security Headers:**
   - For a successful response (status code 200), the script checks if certain security headers are present in the response.
   - The headers being checked are: "Content-Security-Policy," "X-Content-Type-Options," "X-Frame-Options," "Strict-Transport-Security," and "Referrer-Policy."

7. **Logging Missing Headers:**
   - If any of the specified headers are missing, the script appends the URL and the missing headers to a file called "missing_headers.txt."
   - Each line in "missing_headers.txt" contains a URL followed by the list of missing headers for that URL.

8. **Error Handling:**
   - If an error occurs during the HTTP request (handled by `requests.exceptions.RequestException`), it prints an error message.

9. **Process Completion Message:**
   - After processing all URLs, it prints "Process completed."
